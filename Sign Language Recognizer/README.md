## Projectsï¼šSign Language Recognizer

In this project, I will build a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). I will be provided a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video. My goal would be to train a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of this dataset to try and identify individual words from test sequences.
