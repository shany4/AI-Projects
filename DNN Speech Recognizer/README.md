# **Project: DNN Speech Recognizer**

In this notebook, I will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

It begin by investigating the [LibriSpeech dataset](http://www.openslr.org/12/) that will be used to train and evaluate the models. My algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. I will then move on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, I will engage in my own investigations by creating and testing my own state-of-the-art models.
