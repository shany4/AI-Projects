## Project: PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) Project

In this project, I will define a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain discussed in the lectures. 

I will then set up the problems for search, experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems, and then provide an analysis of the results.

Additionally, I will write a short research review paper on the historical development of planning techniques and their use in artificial intelligence. **heuristic_analysis.pdf**
