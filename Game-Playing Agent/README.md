## Project: Game-Playing Agent

### **Coding and Analysis**

1. Download the template code:**[https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Isolation](https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Isolation)**
2. Implement the following functions in `game_agent.py`:
- MinimaxPlayer.minimax(): implement minimax search
- AlphaBetaPlayer.alphabeta(): implement minimax search with alpha-beta pruning
- AlphaBetaPlayer.get_move(): implement iterative deepening search
- custom_score(): implement your own best position evaluation heuristic
- custom_score_2(): implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic
- custom_score_3(): implement your own alternate position evaluation heuristic
1. For each of your three custom heuristic functions, evaluate the performance of the heuristic using the included `tournament.py` script. Then write up a brief summary of your results, describing the performance of the agent using the different heuristic functions verbally and using appropriate visualizations.

Submit the code file: `game_agent.py`Submit your analysis as: `heuristic_analysis.pdf`Your analysis should conclude with a comparison of the different heuristics and your reasoning for choosing the heuristic you ultimately use in your submitted agent.
