## Project: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) project

In this project I will build RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first I will use real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!
